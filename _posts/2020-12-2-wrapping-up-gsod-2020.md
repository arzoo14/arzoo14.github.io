Every journey has a destination and now, I have reached mine. This beautiful journey of three months is now on its verge. These three months were fun, challenging and exciting to me. I made new friends (my mentors) who helped me throughout this journey to overcome the challenges. I learnt a lot from them. I haven't heard of words - Swagger, mankier, Redoc, troff. But I learnt all of them and climbed the stairs of success. As Hermoine and Ron were to Harry Potter, my mentors- Nathan Scott and Andreas Gerstmayr were to me.

This last week, I worked on the project report, also known as final work product. While writing the project report, I remembered all the past weeks, and I can find the smile and happiness on my face. Like my mentor told me after reading my project report, "It's nice to look back and remember all the things you've achieved :smile: - well done - awesome effort!"; yes, it really makes me proud - looking back and remembering all the efforts. Should this be an end?

No, my friend, it's not. I'll continue contributing to Performance Co-Pilot organization and other open source projects as well.

So, in the end, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my mentors - Nathan Scott and Andreas Gerstmayr for their constant support and guidance. They were always around and had solutions to any issue that I faced. I would also like to thank Peter Portante for his guidance on the pbench guides. I would continue with him on adding more content to the pbench guides.

I am grateful to Google and Performance Co-Pilot organization for giving me this golden opportunity :heart:.

Now, it's time for good bye. The Hogwarts Express is waiting for me on Platform 9Â¾ and I have to catch it :running:.
